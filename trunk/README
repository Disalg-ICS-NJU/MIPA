MIPA - Middleware Infrastructure for Predicate detection in Asynchronous environments

INTRODUCTION
=======
In pervasive computing, applications are typically context-aware, thus requring accurate and timely monitoring of the computing environment. This problem is especially challenging in asynchronous environments, where the computing entities do not have a global clock and communications suffer from uncertain delay.

Predicate detection is a promising approach to achieve accurate and timely tracking of whether the context bear specified properties. To support the development and deployment of various predicate detection schemes for different pervasive computing scenarios, we develop the MIPA middleware infrastructure.
